                     DoorMerge  Docs!
                     ----------------


 Hi there.  Well, I'm going to try and make this pretty short but
hopefully understandable. I created the DoorMerge files to work with
Chris Sherricks game  Tradewars v.ii. I started fully from scratch
and ended up with what you see in the DoorMerge files. I admit that
in some ways they aren't very pretty, but they do work. (I've never had
a crash becuase of them) I'm adding to them all the time. And if you
have any suggestions or additions let me know! 
 The downloadable DoorMerge files are made to be compatible with 
Nochange BBS programs. They can be easily modified for other uses.

Each game program is compiled in the same manner:
  
NOTE: Tradewars is now compilable only with QuickBASIC 3.0

Start by compiling the games:

QB filename /W/X/C:512/O;    

So, if you wanted to compile the game POKER  you would use:

QB POKER /W/X/C:512/O;
   
Once you have the files POKER.OBJ and DSUB.OBJ you are ready to LINK
them. Make sure GWCOM.OBJ is on your disk. Use this command:

LINK POKER GWCOM;

You should now have a working Door program!

You can also use the file  DOORSOFT.BAT to automatically complile
the programs. Use the command  DOORSOFT Doorname
    ex:   DOORSOFT TW200     'for Tradewars 200

Once again, if you have any improvements, suggestions or the like,
let me know!

P.S. Just thought I'd add..  'These programs aren't guaranteed (I'd
like them to be but you know how that goes) and all that other jazz
that usually goes in this kind of statement' ('as is' I think they 
call it)
Also, These programs are distributed with a couple of restrictions:
1: I prefer that only sysop's have this source code, and that you
the sysop only accept this code from a known sysop (for security 
reasons) If there is any doubt just D/L the files from my BBS.
2: Do Not distribute this code in modified form. If you have 
improvements to the code let me know and I may incorporate it.

 How to interface your program with the Door Merge modules:
*----------------------------------------------------------*

I'll give several examples on how to interface your program with
the Door Merge files so you can make a working Door program.

The first line of your program should be this:

1 ' $INCLUDE: 'DMERG1.BAS'

This 'Includes' Doormerge file 1 which does initialiation for the Door
program. The next line number should be 9 & 10 (or so)  this makes sure
that there is room for the Dmerg1 file. Most of my programs have a line
'9' & '10' that look like this:

9  DOOR.NAME$ = "DOORNAME"                'This is used in the ERR routine
                                          'and it will be the program name
                                          'displayed on Line 25.

and the line after that:

12 ON.AT$ = TIME$:IF (SNOOP OR L.OCAL = 1) THEN GOSUB LINE25 

15 ' Line 12 gets the time user logged onto game (ON.AT$) and saves it
   ' Then if SNOOP is 'on' (in the RBBS) it will write the info on line 25

Your line 25 will look something like this:

DOORUSER NAME                   DOORNAME               Node: 1    10:25:00

So, let me recap this first part.  The beginning of a program would look
something like this:  (I'll use Tradewars as an example)

1 ' $INCLUDE: 'DMERG1.BAS'
10 ' **/ Trade Wars, by Chris Sherrick  (PTL)  6/86 /**  Copyright 1986 Chris Sherrick
11 ' **/ Modified for use with RBBS by John Morris (Reno RBBS 702-673-3387)
   DOOR.NAME$ = "TW200"
13 ON.AT$ = TIME$:IF (SNOOP OR  L.OCAL = 1) THEN GOSUB LINE25 
15 'Tradewars program starts here:


Now for the other goodies:

I'll give some regular BASIC commands and their equivalent Doormerge commands:

Input a string to program (from Local and/or Remote):

Basic Command:
INPUT "What is your next command",ARG$

Equivalent Doormerge Command:
LN$="What is your next command? ":NORET=1:GOSUB OUT.PUT:GOSUB IN.PUT

'NORET=1 makes sure the line is printed without a carriage return/line feed
'Note: NORET is returned to '0' after the line is printed, so you'll need
'to use NORET=1 whenever you want a line printed without a carriage return/line feed
'GOSUB OUT.PUT prints the line
'GOSUB IN.PUT gets input from user in the form of ARG$


Output a string (to Local and/or Remote)

Basic Command:
PRINT "You have just entered an unmapped sector!"

Equivalent Doormerge Command:
LN$="You have just entered an unmapped sector!":GOSUB OUT.PUT

'Again you can use NORET=1 if you need to print a line without a
'carriage return/line feed

 Late breaking news.  new function:  UPLOW  if set to 1 (UPLOW=1)
all input into door program will be set to capitol letters. Your
Door program should turn UPLOW on and off as needed.

Thats really all there is to it! The Doormerge modules take care of the 
rest (Error logging, Function keys, Time checking, Etc.).

 More news!  Doorsoft games will now accept stacked commands   ie:
 M;4;M;3;P
 That is a Tradewars 200 example. Those caommand printed would move a user
 to sector 3 and then 'port'.
 Also Doorsoft game will also run without the Door Monitor.  This will be
 somewhat useless for Gambling games (Monte, Poker, 21 etc.) But will allow
 for a separate TW200 Door.  Because it is a somewhat useless function for
 gambling type games, the 'no-monitor' mode will be archaic (for the time
 being)  It will give the user 45 minutes of time per game. (it is hard
 coded that way.. but since the source code is available, things are still
 pretty flexible)
 The Doorsoft games also feature error checking in the modules, and if
 an error occurs it will give a somewhat verbose reply telling you the
 problem.

06-28-87
 As of the newest version of Tradewars 2, two special Doormerge files
 will be included: twmerg1 and twmerg2.bas  these are the equivalent of
 the dmerg1.bas and dmerg2.bas files.  The reason for the change is in
 the reduction of the main code segment size of tw2.bas. Also ANSI
 graphics are available in the doormerge files. All you need to do is
 tell the doormerge files the color you want:  ie:   you need to insert
 and FC = x  (forefround)   BC = x  (background) in the code before the
 output call.  Check the New Tradewars Source code for more examples.

Having Problems still?  Contact me at the above number.
