    I am in the habit of distributing source code,  after all what would
 RBBS-PC be without that? So I feel the Doorsoft games should be distributed
 in the same manner. But, I prefer giving the source code out only to
 sysop's to keep things under a certain amount of control. 

[... cut ...]

    You are also free to modify the source code, but Do NOT ditribute it 
 in this modified manner!  If you come up with a some modifications that
 you think are useful, make a BLED merge file and upload it to my system,
 and I'll see about putting it in the next release of the game.

[... cut ...]

     You should make changes in the program, I ask that you don't change
any of the program files when you distribute them.  Make it into another
file and distribute it along with the program, but I ask that you keep
the original programs intact.  This program is copyrighted.

[... cut ...]

     Now for the begging.  This game is distributed as "Shareware."  My
attitude is that I'd rather have people having a good time playing the
game than for me to get rich; but if you could, please send $20.00 to the
address below:

TW2
c/o Chris Sherrick
1515 Ridgeland Dr.
Sparks, NV  89431

If I get something, I'll try to write back, but I can't guarantee anything;
I'm a busy college student.

* DMERG.DOC, a utility added to TW2, by John Morris (The Reno RBBS 702-673-3387):

[... cut ...]

 The downloadable DoorMerge files are made to be compatible with 
Nochange BBS programs. They can be easily modified for other uses.

[... cut ...]

P.S. Just thought I'd add..  'These programs aren't guaranteed (I'd
like them to be but you know how that goes) and all that other jazz
that usually goes in this kind of statement' ('as is' I think they
call it)

Also, These programs are distributed with a couple of restrictions:
1: I prefer that only sysop's have this source code, and that you
the sysop only accept this code from a known sysop (for security
reasons) If there is any doubt just D/L the files from my BBS.
2: Do Not distribute this code in modified form. If you have
improvements to the code let me know and I may incorporate it.
